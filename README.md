**Create+ is a vanilla+ modpack focused on Create, it's addons, and the experience you have using them. It also mainntains most of the balance of vanilla and keeps the game performant enough to run on laptops.**

## ‚ú®Vanilla+
This is half of the reason I made this pack. All the vanilla+ packs I could find were just... not. (Well, at least for what I think counts as vanilla+) The only big content mod in this pack is Create, and I guess its addons as well, because thats the focus of the pack (It _is_ in the name) Otherwise, there's only simple additions, tweaks, an imroved experience, the best type of gear is still netherite, and the game remains about as balanced and polished as vanilla.

## ‚ö°Performance 
Maximally optimized with every optimization mod availible for forge, configured to not conflict and each new one manually tested alongside the rest to see if it actually helps in practice (unlike redirector). I also removed the resource slurping mods so those optimizations wouldn't go to waste (I'm looking at you, sound physics remastered).

## üì∂ Made For Multiplayer
With e4mc included no server setup is needed, allowing you to open your LAN world to the whole world (and thus your friends too), with a server pack still availible to allow you to easily setup a server so your friends can play even when you aren't.

## ‚úÖ All Optifine Features Availible
Most Optifine features are included out of the box and others can be downloaded as extra mods afterwards (skybox and extra gui features are the only ones not included) Fresh Animations and Connected textures are pre-enabled, and Complementary Reimangined can be toggled on with k as soon as you get in a world.
